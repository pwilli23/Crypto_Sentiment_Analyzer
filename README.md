# Crypto_Sentiment_Analyzer

-----

## Executive Summary

The goal of this project is to help users make better investment decisions when buying or selling cryptos by studying the trends that are present in the market. We will create a sentiment analyzer which focuses on the top 10 cryptocurrencies and provides users with a bearish or bullish signal for the respective cryptos on any given day. The portfolio should allow users to determine what they should trade in and/or out of their portfolio.

- Pathlib (a library that enables consistent input and output of files from the main app.)
- hvPlot (a high-level plotting API for the PyData ecosystem built on HoloViews.)
- scikit-learn (an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning.)
- plotly (an interactive, open-source, and browser-based graphing library for Python.)
